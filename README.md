## Abstract of Article

This work develops a novel power control framework for energy-efficient power control in wireless networks. The proposed method is a new branch-and-bound procedure based on problem-specific bounds for energy-efficiency maximization that allow for faster convergence. This enables to find the global solution for all of the most common energy-efficient power control problems with a complexity that, although still exponential in the number of variables, is much lower than other available global optimization frameworks. Moreover, the reduced complexity of the proposed framework allows its practical implementation through the use of deep neural networks. Specifically, thanks to its reduced complexity, the proposed method can be used to train an artificial neural network to predict the optimal resource allocation. This is in contrast with other power control methods based on deep learning, which train the neural network based on suboptimal power allocations due to the large complexity that generating large training sets of optimal power allocations would have with available global optimization methods. As a benchmark, we also develop a novel first-order optimal power allocation algorithm. Numerical results show that a neural network can be trained to predict the optimal power allocation policy.
