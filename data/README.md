## Contents

Randomly generated channels and global optimal power allocation results. `wsee*-processed.h5` contains also first-order optimal power allocations for the test set. Please use `src/DL/prepareDset.py` to generate the training data from these files.

List of files:

* `channels-4.h5`, `channels-7.h5`: Channels used for training and validation for 4 and 7 users, respectively
* `wsee4-processed.h5`, `wsee7-processed.h5`: Global optimal power allocations for `channels.h5`. The training data is generated from this file
* `dset4.h5`, `dset7.h5`: Training, Validation, and Test Data
* `channels-hataUrban.h5`: Channels with Hata-COST231 Urban path loss and log-normal shadowing
* `results_hataUrban.h5`: Global optimal power allocations for `channels-hataUrban.h5`
* `channels-hataUrban-noSF.h5`: Channels with Hata-COST231 Urban path loss (no shaodwing)
* `results_hataUrban_noSF.h5`: Global optimal power allocations for `channels-hataUrban-noSF.h5`
