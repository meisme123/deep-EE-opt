## Contents

This folder contains the complete source code necessary to reproduce the results in the paper. In particular, the subdirectories should be visited in the following order:

1. `channel`: Channel generation
2. `globalOpt`: Global optimization code. Generates the data for the training set.
3. `SCA`: The first-order optimal power allocation algorithm used as baseline performance measure.
4. `DL`: The deep artificial neural network, helper scripts, and evaluation code.

With the data supplied in `../data/`, it is also possible to directly skip to `DL`.
