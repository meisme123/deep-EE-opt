## Contents

The branch-and-bound algorithm to generate the training, validation, and test sets. Short description of files:

* `wsee_lambert.h`: Implementation of the bounding procedure
* `BRB.h`, `util.h`, `util.cpp`: Branch-and-bound algorithm and auxiliary files
* `test_lambert.cpp`: A simple test program for wsee_lambert.h
* `test_wsee.py`: Test script for the Python module
* `wseePy.pyx.m4`: m4 File to Generate the Cython module to interface wsee_lambert.h
* `run_wsee.py`: The script that actually generates the training data
* `slurm/`: `run_wsee.py` and some other scripts are written to run on a HPC system with slurm workload manager. `sbatch.sh` starts several parallel instances of `run_wsee.py`, `sbatch_collect.sh` collects the results in a single file.
* `collect.py`: Collectes results from parallel `run_wsee.py` instances in a single file.
* `setup.py`: Build python module

## Requirements

This code was compiled and tested with Python 3.6.6, [Cython](https://cython.org/) 0.29, [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/mkl) 2017, [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 3.82, and [GCC](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/) 7.3.

In particular, the C++ code is written in C++17 and employs Intel MKL and OpenMP. Intel MKL can be replaced easily if desired. It should only be used to compute logarithms in parallel. Compiling the Cython module requires Cython. We recommend to use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python distribution.

## Building & Running

The following steps are in order to get the Python module running:

1. Adjust paths in `Makefile`
2. Run `make util.o`
3. Adjust paths in `setup.py`
4. Run `python3 setup.py build`
5. Create a link to the newly built module, e.g., `ln -s build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.6/wseePy.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`
6. Test by running `test_wsee.py`
7. Adjust `run_wsee.py` and run it

For debugging purposes it might be desired to first build `test_lambert.cpp` without involving Python. Do so by running `make` without arguments. Be sure to adjust `Makefile` beforehand.
